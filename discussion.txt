- understand variables
  17 variables
  -- FL_DATE
  -- OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER
  -- OP_CARRIER_FL_NUM
  -- ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID
  -- DEST_AIRPORT_ID
  -- DEST_WAC
  -- CRS_DEP_TIME
  -- DEP_TIME
  -- CRS_ARR_TIME
  -- ARR_TIME
  -- CANCELLED
  -- CANCELLATION_CODE
  -- DISTANCE
  -- CARRIER_DELAY
  -- WEATHER_DELAY
  -- NAS_DELAY
  -- NAS_DELAY
  -- LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY

- main features
  -- day of the week
  -- departure delay (min)
  -- arrival delay (min)

- data cleaning
  -- rename varibles
  -- remove reasons for delays (5 variables)

- freature engineering
  -- parse day of the week (YYYY-MM-DD)
  -- departure delay = DEP_TIME - CRS_DEP_TIME
  -- arrival delay = ARR_TIME - CRS_ARR_TIME

- data
  -- flights leave from NY to the other states
  -- three months from October to December
- variable values' range
  -- arrival delay: [-120, 720], reason: T's graph
  -- depature dealy:[-120, 720] 
- structure
  1. dep delay by date
  2. dep delay by the days of the week, eric's pizza heatmap
  3. dep delay by states, eric's pizz map, dep delay with number of flights
  4. box plot of departure delays for each airline with number of flights width
  5. dep delay by airports, maybe main cities, maybe airports in different regions, maybe airports have unique features of delay
  6. dep delay by arrival delay
- attention
  -- make legends to make sure the range
  -- we use the sample data set to generate the figures first, and then move on to the real data set

- Yanni's delay by day
  -- two box plots
  -- (pizza) heatmap  
- Eric's dealy by the day of the week by hour
  -- (pizza) heatmap 
- Kai's delay by states
  -- use arrival delay
  -- (pizza) heatmap; density curve; box plots by regions (see Yanni's plot)
  -- one more exploration
  -- may link to airports
- Costas's arrival vs depature
  

outline
- Yanni's depature delay by date of the month (Uploaded)
- Eric's depature delay by the day of the week and depature time (Uploaded)
- Yanni's depature delay by airline (Uploaded)
- Costas's Dep delay vs arr delay - Nike hexagonal
- Kai's arrival delay by states
- Destnation Airport (Need further discussion based on the visulizatoion)
